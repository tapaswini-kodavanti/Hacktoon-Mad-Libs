Here’s a/an [ADJECTIVE] story that we heard might be true… [VERB] on and decide for yourself! Stefany wanted to do something [ADJECTIVE] at Comic-Con this year. Her favorite part about the show “Supernatural” was the brothers’ car, “Baby,” a/an [COLOR] 1967 Chevy Impala. Ever since Stefany watched the first episode, she had dreamed of owning her own “Baby.” What would be cooler than [VERB ENDING IN “ING”] her own demon-hunting muscle car to Comic-Con? She searched used-car [PLURAL NOUN] online and found an old junker. Then she got her [PART OF BODY (PLURAL)] dirty working under the hood. Soon, her work was complete, and Stefany had a/an [ADJECTIVE] ride. She parked in front of the convention center. Fans swarmed, wanting to pose for [PLURAL NOUN] with the car. A woman in a suit, looking very [ADJECTIVE], approached Stefany and invited the car to appear on an actual episode of the show “Supernatural!” Now “Baby” has her own talent agent. Thanks, Comic-Con!
