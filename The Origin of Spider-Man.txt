My name is Peter Parker. You might look at me and think, “He’s just some [ADJECTIVE] kid from (the) [A PLACE], New York!” but I became a lot more than that the day I was bitten by a radioactive [ANIMAL]. I was on a class trip to (the) [A PLACE] at the time. I am a/an [NOUN] guy, after all. Things got really [ADJECTIVE] when I started to [VERB] weird spider power. I thought I was losing my [PART OF BODY]! At first I thought I could [VERB] my powers to make some quick [PLURAL NOUN], but then I found myself in real trouble. I failed to stop a/an [NOUN] and lost my [ADJECTIVE] Uncle Ben in the process. That’s when I vowed to use my [PLURAL NOUN] to help the people of (the) [A PLACE]. I made a snazzy [NOUN] and began [VERB ENDING IN “ING”] around town as the Amazing Spider-Man!
